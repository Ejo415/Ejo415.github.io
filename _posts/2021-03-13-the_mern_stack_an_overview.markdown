So compounding off of my starting to learn Node.js I decided to jump all the way in and learn the MERN stack as a whole. Whats that I can hear you asking out loud? Im glad you asked.

MongoDB
Express
React
Node

mongoDB is a document database that saves everything as json, Express is a Node.js framework, React is a Javascript framework (which we should all know by now) and Node is a backend JS runtime environment. 

Its all connected like you think it would be, mongoDB is connected to Node which is using Express which communicates with the React front end via RESTful get requests. 

Stacks like MERN (or MEAN) are popular because the entire stack is written in a single language, removing the need for context switching, and are highly scalable.

Thats as much of a high level overview as can be given I do believe. You'll definitely be hearing more from MERN in the furture as I get further into it. Especially from mongoDB, Express and Node. But until then, ive got jury duty next week so please keep me in your thoughts.
