And here I find myself in the midst of my second project, Sinatra. Boy howdy let me tell you how I mismanaged my time with this entire ordeal. I sit here writing this on a Saturday morning after having finished the project yesterday after having hoped to be done with it on Wednesday, giving me two days to polish. That didnt happen but I like to think i managed to get it fairly presentable for human consumtion. I hope to one day be able to sit down and be productive for a whole day as opposed to bits of one.

Probably the biggest challenge for me was with keeping all my relationships straight. Sure I knew who belonged to who and who had many of what (I wrote it after all) but remembering what was supposed to be plural and what wasnt when I was calling class methods tripped me up more than once, and because I like to make things routinely more difficult for myself one of my models was called Crew, singular and plural. Which it turns out ActiveRecord didnt give a single damn about and wanted Crews anyway, so THAT was a fun afternoon. Ultimately I managed to get it all straight and working right. Which, just like last time, felt good to see all come together.

As far as actual coding goes, this one came easier. Sure I still leaned on some lecture videos and office hours a fair bit but this for whatever reason felt more like mine then the CLI did, maybe thats because it was a bigger project. *shrug*  The other thing that was more helpful this go around is that the people in my cohort are starting to come together and bounce problems and ideas off one another more often.

Community helps.
