Alright, so as  you'll learn when you start to do coding problems/interviews having a process is a good thing. I've just found a good strategy so now ill pass it on to you. My loyal viewers...er...readers. This ones gonna be pretty wordy so it stays simple to buckle in.

Solving a coding problem can pretty much be broken down into 5 steps.

###### Understanding the problem

   This part seems obvious but its always important to make sure you actually know whats being asked to begin with.
* 	 Restate the problem back to yourself in a way you understand it (out loud if you're interviewing/in a code review)
* 	 What are the inputs that are going into the function/method/etc.
* 	 What is the output going to have to be.
* 	 Do you have enough information from the inputs to actually solve the problem (usually yes)
* 	 How should you label inportant data in the problem

###### Explore Examples


   Once you're pretty sure you have a grasp on whats even being asked then its a good idea to come up with examples. This is closely tied to understanding the problem. (again do all of this out loud in an interview or code review)
* 	 Thinking up examples can help you undertand the problem better
* 	 Examples can provide you with *early* feedback once you start coding to let you know the code is doing what you want it to.
* 	 Start with simple examples, whats the easiest a to b way to solve the problem. Say you need to add to numbers, an easy example would be 1+1=2
* 	 Move on to more complex examples edge cases, what is the input is left blank, what if a different datatype is entered than what you're looking for? Questioning these are always a good thing in an interview setting.

###### Breaking it down

   This one is easy.
* 	 Pseudo Code

Thats pretty much it. Break down the problem step by step so you know what you'll have to do line by line

```
let someFunction(thing1, thing2) {
//first do this
//then ill need to do that
//after THAT do this
return result
}
```

This will demonstrate your ability to know what you actually need to do in a broad sense even if you might struggle bus a little bit with the nuts and bolts. Pseudo code is impotant.

###### Actually do the thing

   Ok now that know what you actually need to do its time to actually do the thing, first thing to do is simplify your solution.
	 
* 	 Find the main thing that might be tripping you up in your solution
* 	 Ignore that thing
* 	 Then write a more simplified solution
* 	 Reincorporate the thing

Basically what you want to do once you get the actual coding part is to knock out the simplest MVP solution you can get working just so you have working code. THEN you go back and refine it, which brings me to...

###### Refactor

   Now that you have a working solution, its time to refine it to make it more efficient, easy to read and what have you. some questions you can ask yourself are 
	 
* 	 Does the code work, if not go back a step.
* 	 Can you think of a different approach to get the same result
* 	 Is the code readable at a glance
* 	 Is the result/method possibly reusable to solve another probelm (more real world less interview)
* 	 Can you improve the performance
* 	 Can you think of other ways to refactor? 
* 	 How might other people have solved the problem. (that ones more for googling later)

Aaaand thats it. Simple enough way to approach problem solving. Im sure there are other ways and you might even come up with better ways for yourself but this is what ive been working with and figured id pass it along.

Till next time kids.
