Well then.

Yesterday I recieved a pass on my final project assessment, and after i publish this blog post Ill be finished...sorta. Its a weird feeling.

Its certainly been a wild 5 or so months. Made friends, people transfered out of the cohort, people got married, people had kids and we lost BOTH of our cohort instructors. I went in to all of this knowing it was going to be hard and boy howdy did it push me. These last two modules especially, either due to javascript just existing or us having lost our last cohort lead for React and everyone kinda readjusting on the fly. The challenges were real but in the end with the help of my instructors, Google, and the entire cohort leaning on each other, we managed to overcome pretty much everything we ran into. This was NOT a program that can be done on ones own, collabaration with your community is the key to survival. Which I guess is a general rule and not just a Flatiron one.

While this is the end of my time learning at Flatiron (for now maybe), it certainly isnt the end of my journey in Tech. Now I have the distinctly *not nervewracking at all* job of FINDING a job. Its a daunting prospect, putting myself out there after having sorta slap banged all this information into my head in short order. Its certainly a daunting feeling, but then again so was my first day here and yet here we are.

Turns out I can code.
