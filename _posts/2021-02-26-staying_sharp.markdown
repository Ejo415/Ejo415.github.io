I think the next thing im going to do is go back and revist all of my old projects and not refactor them but rebuild them from the ground up, after all iteration is the best way toevolve as it can force you to look at something in a new light as opposed to just looking to make something work in an existing mold.

So my first project was a Brewery Finder CLI in Ruby so naturally the only smart thing for me to do is to pretty much tear it down and rebuild it using React and...Node? Its about to get frisky up in here. The first thing im going to do is actually build out a frontend that allows a user to register and search for breweries wherever they'd like. Then i was thinking of allowing them to favorite breweries and rank them in their profiles.

Brewery API aside, for the backend ill be keeping it rather simple with Users and Breweries with a Breweries > Users model. I've got a biiiiit more planning to do on that end but ill be sure to keep you, dearest readers, apprised of how im going to proceed, i know youll be waiting with bated breath.

Not a huge dump this week but im hoping that will change soon as i move forward with various projects, Node and...*whispers* time complexity.

I dont think it heard me.

Till next time.
