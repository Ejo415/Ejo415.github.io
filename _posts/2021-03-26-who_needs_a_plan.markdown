Im gonna  be real with all of you, planning isnt something ive always been great at. Shocking I know., but when it comes to web design you've realllllly gotta have what you want to do on paper before you start clackin away in your code editor. First things first you'll need to know what you're actually going to make, which if your planning to build an app im relatively sure you already have that. BUT in the evet you dont, do that. See step 1 wasnt so bad.

Next you're gonna want to decide what you want to use to build your project out. Ruby with the sinatra gem? Rails? React with a rails backend? Maybe a Node.js backend? Maybe you wanna use vanilla js? Dunno why you would but you do you. Step 2 done. NOW what you'll wanna do is sketch out how  you want your front end to look, either the old fashioned way on paper or using something like sketch.io. This way youll have a better idea of 1. how everything is gonna look so you can stump out a front end skeleton once you DO start coding and 2. what you'll need when you get into step 4.

Speaking of.

Step 4: plan out your data models. Are you gonna have users? Are there gonna be features like private messaging and image posting? well this is the part where you write down what models you want to use and what belongs to what and the relationship from model to model. 

Now that all of thats done NOW you can spin up your editor and start putting code to screen to make that sketch you made into a reality. Personally i like to get the backend up and running atleast a barebones API so you can start throwing stuff to the front when you stump it out. But thats just me. 

ALL of this is just preference has you get more and more into it im sure you'll get your own process down for planning projects out but from what ive seen they're all some variation of this. 

Happy planning.
