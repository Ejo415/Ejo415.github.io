   More or less a month in and we've come to the first milestone project. I would be lying if I said it didn't freak me out a little bit. You see thus far I had been understanding all of the lessons and labs and concepts just fine, hell I can even read code fairly well its just using it practically hasnt quite clicked yet. But im getting ahead of myself a smidge.
	 
 My project ended up being an API program that would search for local breweries by zip code. I was tempted to lean a little nerdier and do something with the Pokemon API but I stumbled upon the Open Brewery Database and it just sorta spoke to me. Even with some API examples it was a little tricky getting started because as I mentioned the dots werent quite connecting yet when I sat down to a series of blank Class files but once I really got started I was a bit surprised at how well writing the different methods flowed...even when they didnt work.
		
 After some help from my technical coaches, I was able to get past the ultimately uncomplicated walls I had hit. It felt good to `bin/run` and actually work inside of what I had made, and even moreso to enhance it when i had the basics of it down. Turns out do kinda, sorta think I can code, and im excited to see whats next in the program and what i'll be able to do once it all really clicks.
