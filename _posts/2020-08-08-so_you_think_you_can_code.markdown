  Somewhat recently, I came to the realization that I needed a new job...no, not a new job. A new career. There was nowhere to go but right where I was. The thing is, for a new career I would need a whole new skill set, or at least the beginnings of one. Tech in general had been an interest of mine for my whole life, but at 33 and with no experience to speak of, entry into the field was intimidating. Which brings me here, after some perusing of the internet and a couple of recommendations, I discovered that entry might not be so intimidating after all.
			 
			 
If I'm being honest, I havent done anything school related in years, much less written anything of substance that needed structure, so bear with me while I get back to the swing of it. 'Ive barely even really followed the prompt all that well, side effect of typing stream of conciousness I guess. So, why programming? As I mentioned I've always had an interest in tech since I was a kid. From incessantly asking how the cell phone worked, to always looking through the computer to find anything new I could play around with. But that still doesn't quite answer the question does it? Why programming? Well, simply put, I need a new beginning.
